# DOCUMENTATION_AUDIT.md

**Artifact type:** Delivery audit; not a canonical repository authority

**Canonical repository:** `sumosizedginger/My-Game-Engine-1.0`

## Verdict

**PASS**

Structural consistency checks passed: **11/11**.

The bootstrap documentation set is aligned around the corrected project truth: My Game Engine 1.0 is a greenfield canonical implementation repository with an already-designed architecture; earlier repositories are donors/references only.

## Checked Conditions

- [x] **14 bootstrap files present** — All 14 expected bootstrap Markdown files are present.
- [x] **Canonical repo named** — Canonical repository identifier appears across the set.
- [x] **Greenfield truth explicit** — Core orientation/authority docs explicitly identify the repository as greenfield.
- [x] **Node pin consistent** — Node 24.20.0 appears consistently in tooling-governing docs.
- [x] **Canonical count bounded** — The 21-document canonical ceiling is represented consistently.
- [x] **Bootstrap count represented** — README states 12 canonical + two adapters; Documentation Map states the physical bootstrap total of 14.
- [x] **Two entry points represented** — Core product/architecture docs contain both engine entry-point directions.
- [x] **Model shims route to agents/map** — Both model adapters route back to canonical operational docs.
- [x] **No false Visual Lab preservation language** — No instruction to preserve Visual Lab behavior/history as canonical implementation was found.
- [x] **No active conversion instruction** — No active instruction to convert My Engine 2 was found.
- [x] **Planned vs implemented distinction** — Flash-model guardrails explicitly distinguish planned architecture from implementation.

## Semantic Review

### Repository identity

PASS. Core files identify `sumosizedginger/My-Game-Engine-1.0` as canonical. References to `my-engine-2` and original `My-Engine` occur only in donor/reference context.

### Greenfield vs migration

PASS. The set does not instruct builders to preserve Visual Lab behavior or treat prior repository history as canonical. Phase 0 is repository foundation/bootstrap.

### Designed vs implemented

PASS. Named future systems such as Kiln and the Forges are explicitly treated as approved architecture, not proof that production code already exists.

### Flash-model suitability

PASS. `AGENTS.md` and `DOCUMENTATION_MAP.md` require bounded scope, progressive disclosure, exact-state reporting, and explicit distinction between documented, implemented, tested, observed, inferred, and not-yet-implemented facts.

### Donor control

PASS. Donor systems must be classified `PORT / ADAPT / REFERENCE / DROP`; copied or materially adapted code requires provenance and license evidence.

### Licensing language

PASS. MIT is described as the intended direction pending explicit human approval of final legal text. No final legal text is fabricated.

## Changes Made During This Audit

None.

No blocking cross-document contradiction was found, so the canonical 14 files were left unchanged.

## Turn 8 Requirement

Turn 8 should assemble the exact 14 bootstrap Markdown files, the Turn 7 operational artifacts in a clearly noncanonical location, and a manifest/hash file into one final downloadable package.
