# DOCUMENTATION_MAP.md

## Purpose

This file routes humans and AI agents to the **minimum authoritative context required for the active task** in **My Game Engine 1.0**.

Canonical repository:

`sumosizedginger/My-Game-Engine-1.0`

The repository is a **greenfield implementation** of an already-designed architecture.

This map exists to prevent two failures:

1. agents loading so much context that important rules are diluted;
2. agents acting on one document while missing a higher-authority constraint.

Use progressive disclosure.

Read the smallest complete document set that can govern the task.

---

# 1. Authority Order

If documents conflict, use this order:

```text
1. Active explicit human instruction

2. CONSTITUTION.md

3. PRD.md

4. ARCHITECTURE.md

5. Relevant permanent subsystem specification
   - grandfathered root specifications
     (GAMEPLAY_FOUNDATION, GEOMETRY_FORGE, CHARACTER_FORGE,
      MOTION_FORGE, MATERIAL_FORGE, WORLD_FORGE)
   - earned specifications under docs/spec/
   Both are equal in authority within their own subsystem.

6. DEPENDENCY_POLICY.md

7. DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md
   TESTING_AND_VALIDATION.md

8. Accepted running evidence

9. ROADMAP.md

10. CONTEXT.md

11. Temporary work orders, audits, handoffs, notes
```

If permanent documentation and accepted implementation conflict:

**STOP AND REPORT THE CONFLICT.**

Do not silently choose.

Do not rewrite permanent law merely to make existing code look correct.

---

# 2. Document Classes

Every documentation file should belong to one of these classes.

## AUTHORITATIVE SPEC

Defines what the project is, what must be true, or how a subsystem is architecturally constrained.

Examples:

- `CONSTITUTION.md`
- `PRD.md`
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- future subsystem specifications

These may govern implementation.

## EARNED SUBSYSTEM SPECIFICATION

Defines the permanent architecture and contracts of one subsystem, after real implementation has earned it.

Location:

`docs/spec/`

Pattern:

```text
docs/spec/<domain>.md
```

Use `docs/spec/<domain>/` only when a domain genuinely holds more than one earned document. Do not create a directory in anticipation of one.

An earned subsystem specification is:

- permanent;
- authoritative within its own subsystem;
- below `CONSTITUTION.md`, `PRD.md` and `ARCHITECTURE.md`;
- equal in subsystem authority to the grandfathered root Forge specifications;
- above implementation-local convention;
- routed explicitly through this map;
- loaded only when its subsystem is relevant to the active task;
- created **only after implementation earns it**.

These documents are outside the core canonical count (see §3 and §4). That is the whole point: the engine can grow subsystems without growing the set of documents every task must read.

The six existing root-level Forge specifications are **grandfathered at their current paths**. They are not moved. Moving them would create widespread cross-reference churn across this map, the learning documents and source file headers for no routing benefit. New earned specifications use `docs/spec/`.

## OPERATIONAL POLICY

Defines how work is performed and accepted.

Examples:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `HANDOFF_PROTOCOL.md`
- `DEPENDENCY_POLICY.md`
- `DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md`
- `TESTING_AND_VALIDATION.md`
- `DOCUMENTATION_MAP.md`

## CONTEXT / ROADMAP

Explains history, current stage, risks, and sequencing.

Examples:

- `CONTEXT.md`
- `ROADMAP.md`

These do not outrank architecture.

## LEARNING

Teaches accepted public behavior.

Location:

`docs/learn/`

Entry points:

- `docs/learn/README.md`
- `docs/learn/BUILDING_A_TINY_GAME.md`
- `docs/learn/BUILDING_A_WALKING_CHARACTER.md`
- `docs/learn/BUILDING_A_PROCEDURAL_COMBAT_ROOM.md`
- `docs/learn/BUILDING_A_BOUNDED_PROCEDURAL_WORLD.md`
- `docs/learn/BUILDING_A_DIFFERENT_GENRE.md`
- `docs/learn/BUILDING_AN_UNPLANNED_GAME.md`

Learning documents do not override canonical architecture.

## ADR

Records a significant architecture decision and its rationale.

Location:

`docs/adr/`

ADRs are created only when a decision is significant enough to preserve.

## ARCHIVE

Historical material that may be worth retaining but is no longer active truth.

Location:

`docs/archive/`

Archived files do not govern implementation.

## TEMPORARY WORK ORDER

An authorized bounded instruction for one tranche of work: scope, constraints, and what to return.

A temporary work order is **subordinate to every permanent document above**. It directs work; it does not define architecture. It may not amend the Constitution, the PRD, the architecture or an earned specification, and it may not outrank them merely by being recent or by describing itself as current truth.

When its tranche is accepted, its durable content must be encoded into code, tests, schemas or permanent documents, and the work order is archived. `CONSTITUTION.md` §29 requires this. A completed work order left at repository root is scaffolding that has outlived its build.

Location: `ops/` for new work orders, `docs/archive/` once complete.

## MODEL ADAPTER

Tiny tool-specific entry files.

Examples:

- `CLAUDE.md`
- `GEMINI.md`

These route agents to the canonical docs.

They are not independent authorities.

---

# 3. Bootstrap Canonical Set

At repository bootstrap, the canonical project documentation is:

```text
README.md
CONSTITUTION.md
PRD.md
ARCHITECTURE.md
CONTEXT.md
ROADMAP.md
AGENTS.md
HANDOFF_PROTOCOL.md
DEPENDENCY_POLICY.md
DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md
TESTING_AND_VALIDATION.md
DOCUMENTATION_MAP.md
```

Model adapters:

```text
CLAUDE.md
GEMINI.md
```

Total physical Markdown files at bootstrap:

`14`

Core canonical project-document count:

`12`

The model adapters do not count toward the core canonical maximum. Neither do ADRs, learning documents, earned specifications under `docs/spec/`, or community and legal files.

---

# 4. Core Canonical Set and Earned Specifications

`CONSTITUTION.md` §29 sets the ceiling:

```text
MAXIMUM INTENDED CORE CANONICAL DURABLE SET = 21
```

That number counts **core** documents only. It is a limit on what every task might have to read, not a limit on how much the engine may document.

## 4.1 Core canonical set — currently 18 of 21

The 12 bootstrap documents in §3, plus six earned subsystem specifications grandfathered at repository root:

```text
GAMEPLAY_FOUNDATION.md   (Earned by Proof A)
GEOMETRY_FORGE.md        (Earned by Proof B2)
CHARACTER_FORGE.md       (Earned by Proof B1)
MOTION_FORGE.md          (Earned by Proof B1)
MATERIAL_FORGE.md        (Earned by Proof B2)
WORLD_FORGE.md           (Earned by Proof C)
```

These six do not move. See the EARNED SUBSYSTEM SPECIFICATION class in §2.

## 4.2 Reserved core slots — 3 remaining

```text
PERFORMANCE_AND_PROFILING.md    reserved, not created
VISUAL_TARGETS_AND_BENCHMARKS.md reserved, not created
(one slot intentionally unallocated)
```

Both reserved documents are retained at **core** level deliberately, because each is cross-cutting policy rather than subsystem behavior. Performance budgets and visual acceptance criteria are read by every tranche that touches performance or appearance, whatever subsystem it belongs to. Filing them under one subsystem would hide them from the tranches that most need them.

Neither has been created. Neither may be created before implementation evidence earns it: `CONSTITUTION.md` §24 and this map's §34 both forbid inventing a document ahead of its need.

The third slot is left unallocated on purpose. Unspent capacity is architectural flexibility, not waste.

`AUDIO_AND_FX.md` was previously a reserved root slot. It is **no longer reserved at root**. Audio is subsystem-scoped rather than cross-cutting, so when audio implementation earns a permanent specification it belongs at `docs/spec/audio.md`. Nothing is created now; no audio implementation exists.

## 4.3 Earned specifications — outside the core count

```text
docs/spec/<domain>.md
```

### Existing

```text
docs/spec/scene.md    Scene and composition.
                      Earned by SCENE-COMPOSITION-001.
                      Implementation: src/scene/**, src/render/scene-presentation.js
```

### Domains that may plausibly earn one eventually

Kiln compilation, physics, animation graphs, story graphs, timelines, persistence, import, streaming, networking, UI and audio.

**That list is not a plan, an authorization, or a set of reserved slots.** It exists so a future agent recognizes that these are expected to be subsystem-scoped rather than core when their time comes.

Do not create any of them now. Do not create placeholder files. A subsystem earns a permanent specification when real accepted implementation makes one useful, and not before.

## 4.4 What belongs where

| Kind of truth | Home |
| --- | --- |
| Project law | `CONSTITUTION.md` |
| Product requirement | `PRD.md` |
| Cross-system boundary | `ARCHITECTURE.md` |
| Cross-cutting policy read by every tranche | core document |
| One subsystem's permanent contracts | earned specification |
| How one module currently works | the module and its tests |
| Active bounded work | temporary work order |

If a detail concerns exactly one subsystem, it does not belong in `ARCHITECTURE.md`. If it is needed to perform unrelated work, it does not belong in an earned specification.

---

# 5. Always-Read Core for Material Work

For material production work, begin with:

```text
CONSTITUTION.md
PRD.md
ARCHITECTURE.md
AGENTS.md
DOCUMENTATION_MAP.md
```

Then load only the task-specific documents below.

For a tiny mechanical edit with no architecture impact, the active work order plus `AGENTS.md` and the directly relevant spec may be enough.

When uncertain, read the higher-authority document rather than guessing.

## 5.1 Progressive disclosure for permanent subsystem specifications

Load the minimum complete permanent specification set required for the active task.

If more than two subsystem specifications are required, explicitly justify why the work cannot safely be separated into smaller tranches. Needing three subsystems at once is a signal worth examining, not a violation: some work legitimately crosses several domains, and forcing an artificial split would be worse than reading three documents.

This is a heuristic that makes you think, not a rule that decides for you. Do not let a document count determine architecture.

## 5.2 Specification size

Prefer bounded, coherent specifications. Split one when distinct, independently useful subdomains genuinely emerge.

Do not split a coherent specification because it crossed a line count. A single 650-line specification that reads straight through is better evidence than two 330-line documents that force an agent to jump between them.

---

# 6. Phase 0 — Repository Foundation

Status meaning:

Phase 0 establishes the trustworthy greenfield repository foundation.

It does **not** implement the full engine.

Read:

```text
CONSTITUTION.md
PRD.md
ARCHITECTURE.md
ROADMAP.md
AGENTS.md
DEPENDENCY_POLICY.md
DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md
TESTING_AND_VALIDATION.md
HANDOFF_PROTOCOL.md
```

Also read:

```text
CONTEXT.md
```

when inspecting donor lineage or explaining why prior repositories are not canonical.

Phase 0 concerns include:

- Node/toolchain pinning;
- package baseline;
- minimal source/test structure;
- browser/dev-server boot;
- minimal runtime skeleton;
- `engine/runtime` / `engine/full` direction;
- build/test/run commands;
- exact clean baseline.

Do not load future Forge documents because they should not exist yet.

---

# 7. A0 — Evaluation Harness

Read:

```text
CONSTITUTION.md
ARCHITECTURE.md
ROADMAP.md
AGENTS.md
DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md
TESTING_AND_VALIDATION.md
HANDOFF_PROTOCOL.md
```

Focus:

- deterministic captures;
- browser automation;
- runtime diagnostics;
- telemetry;
- exact revision reporting;
- comparison/evaluation infrastructure.

Operational note:
See `TESTING_AND_VALIDATION.md` §22.1 for canonical evaluation operations (`npm run eval`, `artifacts/evaluation-report.json`, `artifacts/captures/`, and `src/eval/*` harness layout).

Do not expand gameplay merely because test infrastructure can support it.

---

# 8. Proof A — Tiny Complete Game

When Proof A begins, create/read:

```text
GAMEPLAY_FOUNDATION.md
```

Required set:

```text
CONSTITUTION.md
PRD.md
ARCHITECTURE.md
GAMEPLAY_FOUNDATION.md
AGENTS.md
DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md
TESTING_AND_VALIDATION.md
DEPENDENCY_POLICY.md
```

Relevant concerns:

- entities;
- transforms;
- input actions;
- movement;
- collision;
- runtime variables;
- state;
- rules;
- scripts if needed;
- DOM UI;
- tiny Kiln seam;
- static export;
- controller/keyboard abstraction.

Operational note:
See `TESTING_AND_VALIDATION.md` §22.1 for evaluation harness operations covering Proof A targets, checks (`pongBoot`, `pongGameplay`, `pongScoring`), and capture fixtures.

Learning note:
See `docs/learn/BUILDING_A_TINY_GAME.md` for the accepted learning extraction and architecture walkthrough of Proof A.

Do not import later character/world complexity.

---

# 9. Proof B1 — Motion Truth

When B1 begins, create/read as earned:

```text
CHARACTER_FORGE.md
MOTION_FORGE.md
```

Also read:

```text
CONSTITUTION.md
ARCHITECTURE.md
AGENTS.md
DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md
TESTING_AND_VALIDATION.md
DEPENDENCY_POLICY.md
```

Relevant concerns:

- canonical procedural humanoid definition;
- semantic landmarks;
- skeleton generation;
- procedural skin weights;
- one parameterized walk;
- grounding;
- minimal IK;
- root motion;
- transform-authority compliance;
- deformation quality;
- deterministic visual evaluation.

Operational note:
See `TESTING_AND_VALIDATION.md` §22.1 for evaluation harness operations covering Proof B1 targets (`?proof=b1&controlled=1`), checks (`b1Boot`, `b1CharacterGeneration`, `b1MotionExecution`, `b1GroundingCheck`), and capture fixtures (`artifacts/captures/proof_b1_motion_fixture.png`).

Learning note:
See `docs/learn/BUILDING_A_WALKING_CHARACTER.md` for the accepted B1 learning extraction and architecture walkthrough.

Do not hide failed motion behind unrelated effects or environments.

---

# 10. Proof B2 — Procedural Combat Room

Create/read as earned:

```text
GEOMETRY_FORGE.md
CHARACTER_FORGE.md
MOTION_FORGE.md
MATERIAL_FORGE.md
GAMEPLAY_FOUNDATION.md
```

Also read:

```text
CONSTITUTION.md
ARCHITECTURE.md
DEPENDENCY_POLICY.md
DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md
TESTING_AND_VALIDATION.md
```

Relevant concerns:

- generated room;
- geometry semantics;
- surface/region identity;
- procedural character;
- motion;
- minimal materials;
- collision;
- combat;
- audio/FX hooks if required;
- browser/runtime evidence.

Operational note:
See `TESTING_AND_VALIDATION.md` §22.1 for evaluation harness operations covering Proof B2 targets (`?proof=b2&controlled=1`), checks (`b2Boot`, `b2RoomGeneration`, `b2MaterialGeneration`, `b2CharacterIntegration`, `b2CombatExecution`, `b2WinState`), and capture fixtures (`artifacts/captures/proof_b2_combat_fixture.png`).

Learning note:
See `docs/learn/BUILDING_A_PROCEDURAL_COMBAT_ROOM.md` for the accepted integration walkthrough.

Use direct procedural construction when simpler than CSG.

---

# 11. Proof C — Bounded Procedural World

For the implemented Proof C builder revision, read:

```text
WORLD_FORGE.md
MATERIAL_FORGE.md
```

Also read relevant:

```text
GAMEPLAY_FOUNDATION.md
CHARACTER_FORGE.md
MOTION_FORGE.md
CONSTITUTION.md
ARCHITECTURE.md
DEPENDENCY_POLICY.md
DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md
TESTING_AND_VALIDATION.md
```

Relevant concerns:

- bounded terrain;
- WorldRecipe;
- WorldFieldCache;
- environmental fields;
- deterministic vegetation;
- WorldFieldQuery;
- WorldVolumeQuery;
- grounding;
- world collision;
- traversal.

Do not prebuild huge-world streaming.

Implementation routing: `src/world/index.js` owns bounded generation and queries;
`src/games/world/` owns traversal and its controlled proof; `src/browser/c-viewer.js`
owns live/controlled presentation. See `tests/world.test.js` and
`tests/world-browser.test.js` for actual contracts.

Learning note:
See `docs/learn/BUILDING_A_BOUNDED_PROCEDURAL_WORLD.md` for the accepted world-generation/traversal walkthrough.

---

# 12. Proof D — Different Genre

Implementation routing: `src/games/racing/track.js` owns the project circuit
definition, geometry, shared barrier segments and gate frames; `game.js` owns
kinematics and ordered race progression; `camera.js` and `renderer.js` own
presentation. `src/browser/d-viewer.js` provides lazy live/controlled routes.
Read `GAMEPLAY_FOUNDATION.md` §5.6 for the generic scalar input extension and
`TESTING_AND_VALIDATION.md` §22.1 for the sixth evaluator target. Focused proof
contracts are in `tests/racing.test.js` and `tests/racing-browser.test.js`.
There is no Character, Motion or World Forge dependency in this game.

Learning note:
See `docs/learn/BUILDING_A_DIFFERENT_GENRE.md` for the accepted Proof D learning extraction and architecture walkthrough.

Read:

```text
CONSTITUTION.md
PRD.md
ARCHITECTURE.md
GAMEPLAY_FOUNDATION.md
```

Then load only subsystem specs required by the chosen genre.

Primary question:

> Can a mechanically different game be built without rewriting foundational engine laws?

Inspect whether the proof requires fundamental changes to:

- entity identity;
- fixed simulation;
- event dispatch;
- transform ownership;
- state;
- save model;
- public API boundaries.

A genre-specific feature defaults to project code.

Do not promote it into core merely because one proof needs it.

---

# 13. Proof E — Blind API Generality Test

Fresh consumer should receive only the public-facing material necessary to use the engine.

Primary inputs should eventually include:

```text
README.md
public API/reference documentation
docs/learn/
build/run instructions
engine package
```

Do not provide internal architecture reasoning unless the test explicitly targets engine contributors.

Internal validator/orchestrator should read:

```text
PRD.md
ARCHITECTURE.md
DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md
TESTING_AND_VALIDATION.md
```

Purpose:

- expose missing public APIs;
- expose hidden state;
- expose poor naming;
- expose undocumented assumptions;
- expose unnecessary boilerplate.

If users repeatedly need internal access, determine whether the API or documentation is wrong.

Do not merely explain a terrible API more loudly.

See `docs/learn/BUILDING_AN_UNPLANNED_GAME.md` for the accepted Proof E learning extraction and blind generality walkthrough.

---

# 14. Donor Inspection / Porting

When inspecting any donor, read:

```text
CONTEXT.md
CONSTITUTION.md
ARCHITECTURE.md
DEPENDENCY_POLICY.md
AGENTS.md
```

Then inspect the actual donor repository and license.

Classify each candidate:

```text
PORT
ADAPT
REFERENCE
DROP
```

Do not classify entire repositories as one unit when individual systems differ.

Required adoption questions:

```text
Does it match current architecture?

Is it generic enough?

Is the API appropriate?

Are its tests useful?

Would a cleaner greenfield implementation be better?

Does it import unwanted historical baggage?

Is the license compatible?

Can provenance be recorded exactly?
```

Donor code has evidence priority, not constitutional priority.

---

# 14.5 Public Surface Maintenance

Changing what the package exports is a contract change, not a refactor.

Read:

```text
ARCHITECTURE.md 49
PRD.md 39
tests/purity.test.js
```

The contract lives in four places, deliberately, and they are cross-checked:

- `ARCHITECTURE.md` 49 — the boundary, the implemented shape, the exclusions and why;
- `tests/purity.test.js` — the ENFORCED allowlist; adding a public export means editing it on purpose;
- `AUTHORING_SURFACE` in `src/full/authoring.js` — the machine-readable description, asserted both ways so nothing is advertised-but-absent or public-but-undiscoverable;
- `README.md` — the developer-facing summary.

There is no separate public-surface specification. A fifth document describing
the same contract would be the hand-maintained encyclopedia §34 warns about,
and it would drift first.

Before exporting anything, classify it PUBLIC NOW, INTERNAL or DEFERRED, and
record the reason for anything excluded. "We forgot" and "we decided" look
identical from outside a package.

---

# 15. Dependency Admission

For any new production dependency, read:

```text
DEPENDENCY_POLICY.md
CONSTITUTION.md
ARCHITECTURE.md
```

If the dependency affects tests or evidence, also read:

```text
TESTING_AND_VALIDATION.md
```

Do not add a dependency before checking:

- purpose;
- license;
- maintenance/risk;
- architectural boundary;
- bundle/runtime impact;
- deterministic implications;
- fallback implications;
- whether native code would be simpler.

---

# 16. Runtime / Simulation Changes

Read:

```text
CONSTITUTION.md
ARCHITECTURE.md
GAMEPLAY_FOUNDATION.md
TESTING_AND_VALIDATION.md
DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md
```

when `GAMEPLAY_FOUNDATION.md` exists.

Pay special attention to:

- fixed-step simulation;
- transform authority;
- input snapshot timing;
- events;
- timers;
- state;
- deterministic RNG;
- entity lifetime;
- pause/time scale.

No subsystem creates an independent gameplay frame loop.

---

# 17. Identity / Persistence / Save Work

Read:

```text
CONSTITUTION.md
ARCHITECTURE.md
GAMEPLAY_FOUNDATION.md
TESTING_AND_VALIDATION.md
```

Relevant laws:

- runtime `EntityHandle(index, generation)`;
- handles are not serialized;
- persistent IDs exist for persistent relationships/state;
- pooling increments generations;
- snapshot-first saves;
- replay is separate;
- canonical definition hashing is shared where specified.

---

# 18. Geometry Work

When available, read:

```text
GEOMETRY_FORGE.md
ARCHITECTURE.md
CONSTITUTION.md
DEPENDENCY_POLICY.md
TESTING_AND_VALIDATION.md
```

Relevant concepts:

- definitions are source;
- compiled geometry is artifact;
- semantic identity must not depend on brittle vertex index ranges;
- use `regionId`, `surfaceId`, and appropriate flags;
- use `SemanticLandmarks` for stable named definition-space anchors;
- topology-changing operations must define semantic propagation;
- silent semantic inference is prohibited.

---

# 19. Character Work

When available, read:

```text
CHARACTER_FORGE.md
GEOMETRY_FORGE.md
MOTION_FORGE.md
ARCHITECTURE.md
TESTING_AND_VALIDATION.md
VISUAL_TARGETS_AND_BENCHMARKS.md
```

only when those files have been legitimately created.

Primary questions include:

- anatomy/shape plausibility;
- landmark stability;
- skeleton generation;
- skinning;
- deformation;
- motion quality;
- grounding;
- aesthetic failure criteria.

Do not assume planned files exist.

---

# 20. Motion Work

When available, read:

```text
MOTION_FORGE.md
CHARACTER_FORGE.md
ARCHITECTURE.md
TESTING_AND_VALIDATION.md
```

Motion should operate through semantic representations and compiled/runtime systems.

No LLM computes bones frame-by-frame.

Animation does not bypass transform authority.

---

# 21. Material / Rendering Work

When available, read:

```text
MATERIAL_FORGE.md
ARCHITECTURE.md
DEPENDENCY_POLICY.md
TESTING_AND_VALIDATION.md
VISUAL_TARGETS_AND_BENCHMARKS.md
```

Relevant architecture:

- WebGPU preferred;
- WebGL2 meaningful fallback;
- TSL/shared material logic where useful;
- procedural inputs may be baked through Kiln;
- avoid expensive runtime procedural work merely for philosophical purity.

Do not import a renderer architecture from a donor wholesale.

---

# 22. World Work

When available, read:

```text
WORLD_FORGE.md
MATERIAL_FORGE.md
ARCHITECTURE.md
DEPENDENCY_POLICY.md
TESTING_AND_VALIDATION.md
PERFORMANCE_AND_PROFILING.md
```

only if the performance document has been earned.

World query split:

```text
WorldFieldQuery
→ cheap/bulk 2.5D environmental information

WorldVolumeQuery
→ authoritative 3D spatial truth
```

Anything requiring correctness beneath overhangs, inside caves, or across stacked floors uses volumetric truth.

---

# 23. Audio / FX Work

When the subsystem becomes substantial, read:

```text
docs/spec/audio.md
ARCHITECTURE.md
DEPENDENCY_POLICY.md
TESTING_AND_VALIDATION.md
```

`docs/spec/audio.md` does not exist. No audio implementation exists. Audio is subsystem-scoped rather than cross-cutting, so it earns a specification in the earned tier rather than a core root slot (§4.2). It was previously reserved as a root `AUDIO_AND_FX.md`; that reservation was retired by GENERAL-ENGINE-DIRECTION-001.

Before the dedicated file exists, architecture plus implementation/tests govern the small system.

Do not create an industrial graph system because the roadmap mentions future effects.

---

# 23.5 Scene and Composition Work

Read:

```text
docs/spec/scene.md
ARCHITECTURE.md
GAMEPLAY_FOUNDATION.md
TESTING_AND_VALIDATION.md
```

Covers scene composition, hierarchy, scene serialization, scene artifacts and scene lifecycle.

Relevant laws:

- a scene is engine data, never a renderer scene graph;
- persistent authored `pid` is source identity; `EntityHandle` is runtime identity and is never serialized;
- a parented node uses `TRANSFORM_OWNERSHIP.ATTACHED`; composition adds no second per-tick transform writer;
- no global scene singleton: two `SceneInstance`s must be able to coexist.

Do not load this document for rendering, geometry authoring or runtime simulation work.

---

# 24. Performance Work

When real performance work begins, create/read:

```text
PERFORMANCE_AND_PROFILING.md
```

Also read:

```text
ARCHITECTURE.md
TESTING_AND_VALIDATION.md
DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md
```

Performance claims require measurements.

Do not invent budgets before a baseline exists.

---

# 25. Visual Quality Work

When a stable visual bar becomes necessary, create/read:

```text
VISUAL_TARGETS_AND_BENCHMARKS.md
```

Also read relevant subsystem specs and:

```text
TESTING_AND_VALIDATION.md
DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md
```

Visual acceptance requires controlled runtime evidence.

Code inspection alone cannot certify appearance.

---

# 26. Static Export Work

Read:

```text
PRD.md
ARCHITECTURE.md
GAMEPLAY_FOUNDATION.md
DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md
TESTING_AND_VALIDATION.md
DEPENDENCY_POLICY.md
```

when applicable.

Required product direction:

```text
Project
→ compile/bake
→ static JS/assets/definitions
→ static host
→ browser
```

Ordinary exported games must not require Studio or a mandatory game server merely to boot.

---

# 27. Studio Integration Work

Read:

```text
CONSTITUTION.md
PRD.md
ARCHITECTURE.md
CONTEXT.md
```

Then inspect the current Studio contract/repository.

Boundary:

```text
GUI / CLI / AI / Tests
→ Project Operations
→ Project Data
→ Runtime Adapter
→ My Game Engine 1.0
→ Game
```

Studio is separate.

Exported games do not depend on Studio.

The engine owns runtime truth.

---

# 28. Learning Extraction

Only after a public behavior/proof is accepted, read:

```text
README.md
DOCUMENTATION_MAP.md
relevant canonical subsystem specification
relevant public API implementation
relevant accepted example/proof
```

Create/update:

```text
docs/learn/
examples/
```

according to actual accepted behavior.

Learning material must:

- use public APIs;
- build/run where applicable;
- state prerequisites;
- produce a real outcome;
- explain why the engine behaves that way;
- avoid temporary build archaeology.

Canonical docs describe the machine.

Lessons teach the machine.

---

# 29. ADR Creation

Create an ADR only for a significant decision worth preserving.

Before creating one, ask:

```text
Will a future maintainer need to know why this architectural choice was made?

Were multiple viable options considered?

Would losing the rationale invite repeated redesign?
```

If no, do not create an ADR.

ADRs should record:

- context;
- decision;
- alternatives;
- consequences;
- status;
- relevant revision/date.

ADRs do not replace current canonical specs.

If a decision changes current architecture, update the authoritative architecture/spec as part of the same accepted tranche.

---

# 30. Validation / Audit

Validator reads:

```text
CONSTITUTION.md
ARCHITECTURE.md
AGENTS.md
DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md
TESTING_AND_VALIDATION.md
HANDOFF_PROTOCOL.md
```

plus:

- the task-specific subsystem specs;
- the exact work order;
- the exact target revision.

Validator should not load unrelated future design material.

Validator must separate:

```text
BLOCKING
IMPORTANT
NON-BLOCKING
OPTIONAL
```

---

# 31. Repair Work

Repair agent reads:

```text
the accepted audit findings
the exact audited revision
the relevant canonical specs
TESTING_AND_VALIDATION.md
DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md
HANDOFF_PROTOCOL.md

Repair the findings.

Do not reopen the entire design unless the finding proves an architectural contradiction.

After material repair, stop for re-audit.

# 32. Independent Verification

Verifier reads:

```text
the exact audited revision
the relevant build/run instructions
DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md
TESTING_AND_VALIDATION.md
HANDOFF_PROTOCOL.md
```

and only enough architecture/spec context to know the required behavior.

Prefer clean checkout/worktree.

Verifier does not redesign or repair.

# 33. README Routing

`README.md` is the human entry point.

It should route:

```text
What is this?
→ README.md

What laws govern it?
→ CONSTITUTION.md

What must the product do?
→ PRD.md

How is it organized?
→ ARCHITECTURE.md

What stage are we in?
→ ROADMAP.md

Why does this project exist / where did it come from?
→ CONTEXT.md

How should an agent work here?
→ AGENTS.md

How do I decide what to read?
→ DOCUMENTATION_MAP.md

How is work accepted?
→ DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md
→ TESTING_AND_VALIDATION.md

How do agents pass work?
→ HANDOFF_PROTOCOL.md

Can I add this library?
→ DEPENDENCY_POLICY.md

How do I learn to build with it?
→ docs/learn/README.md
  when learning material exists
```

# 34. Do Not Invent Missing Documents

If this map references a future subsystem document that does not yet exist:

that means the subsystem has not yet earned that permanent specification.

Do not fabricate the missing file in the middle of an unrelated task.

If the current work genuinely reaches that subsystem, the orchestrator should explicitly authorize creation of the spec.

This applies equally to `docs/spec/`. The earned tier is not a place to file speculative design. A specification that cannot name the implementation it describes and the tests that hold that implementation to it has not been earned, and should be deleted rather than kept.

`docs/spec/` now exists, holding one document: `docs/spec/scene.md`, earned by SCENE-COMPOSITION-001. Its existence is not permission to add neighbours. Each further document is earned the same way, by implementation that already exists.

A document describing a system that does not exist is worse than no document: it reads as capability to every future agent that finds it.

# 35. Do Not Treat This Map as Architecture

This file routes context.

It does not define subsystem behavior.

If this map and `ARCHITECTURE.md` disagree about architecture:

`ARCHITECTURE.md` wins.

If this map and `CONSTITUTION.md` disagree about project law:

`CONSTITUTION.md` wins.

Fix the map afterward.

# 36. Flash-Model Reading Rule

For smaller-context or faster models:

1. read the active work order;
2. read `AGENTS.md`;
3. read this map;
4. load the exact documents named for that task;
5. inspect the relevant code;
6. do not infer missing architecture from filenames or donor repositories.

When reporting work, distinguish explicitly:

```text
DOCUMENTED
IMPLEMENTED
TESTED
OBSERVED
INFERRED
NOT YET IMPLEMENTED
```

This distinction is mandatory whenever ambiguity could cause an agent to mistake future architecture for current code.

# 37. Final Routing Law

Use the smallest context that still contains every governing constraint.

Too little context causes architecture drift.

Too much context causes instruction dilution.

`DOCUMENTATION_MAP.md` exists to keep the agent between those two failures.
