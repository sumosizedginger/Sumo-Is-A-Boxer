## 1. Core Architectural Laws

1. **Transform Authority Compliance**: Animation and locomotion systems NEVER directly mutate world entity transforms. Locomotion produces local bone poses and horizontal displacement increments as `rootMotionIntent`; the engine's authoritative transform manager commits entity position.
2. **Organic Living Motion Over Mechanical Rigidity**: Locomotion must express the dynamic physical realities of human movement: double-frequency vertical bounce, lateral weight shifts over stance limbs, pelvic roll, transverse pelvic yaw, and counter-phase torso rotation.
3. **Continuous Periodic Gait Phase**: Locomotion cycles evaluate continuously over normalized phase $\phi \in [0, 1)$. The left leg evaluates at $\phi_L = \phi$; the right leg evaluates exactly half a cycle out of phase ($\phi_R = (\phi + 0.5) \pmod 1.0$). Loop boundaries wrap with zero jerk or discontinuity.
4. **Stance & Swing Phasing**: Each leg cycle divides into a 60% ground stance phase ($\phi \in [0, 0.60]$) and a 40% aerial swing phase ($\phi \in [0.60, 1.0]$).
5. **Analytical 2-Bone IK Without Popping**: Leg kinematics use closed-form analytical 2-bone inverse kinematics with smooth reach clamping strictly below $L_1 + L_2$ to eliminate mathematical singularities and knee hyper-extension popping.
6. **Strict Realized Grounding Guarantee**: Grounding is evaluated on the actual realized world positions of rendered foot bones (`foot_l`, `foot_r`), not analytic targets. During stance phase, realized foot bone world height must remain within: $Y_{\text{realized}} \le \text{footH} + 0.025\text{ m}$ (max float $\le 25\text{ mm}$, mean float $\le 10\text{ mm}$) and $Y_{\text{realized}} \ge \text{footH} - 0.001\text{ m}$ (zero floor penetration).
7. **Counter-Phase Arm Dynamics**: The contralateral arm swings forward with the advancing leg, featuring organic compound elbow flexion ($\approx 40^\circ$ forward arc) and secondary wrist lag trailing swing velocity.

## 2. Locomotion Parameter Domain & Presets

Gait dynamics derive from bounded parameters in `MOTION_PARAMETER_BOUNDS`:

## 3. Analytical 2-Bone Inverse Kinematics

Given root joint $A$ (Hip), target joint $C$ (Ankle), upper length $L_1$ (Thigh), and lower length $L_2$ (Shin):

### 3.1 Distance & Reach Clamping

$$D = |\vec{C} - \vec{A}|$$
$$D_{\text{clamped}} = \max\left( |L_1 - L_2| \cdot 1.002, \min(D, (L_1 + L_2) \cdot 0.9998) \right)$$

### 3.2 Law of Cosines

$$\cos \alpha = \frac{L_1^2 + D_{\text{clamped}}^2 - L_2^2}{2 L_1 D_{\text{clamped}}}$$
$$\cos \beta = \frac{L_1^2 + L_2^2 - D_{\text{clamped}}^2}{2 L_1 L_2}$$
$$\alpha = \arccos(\text{clamp}(\cos \alpha, -1, 1))$$
$$\beta = \arccos(\text{clamp}(\cos \beta, -1, 1))$$
$$\theta_{\text{flexion}} = \pi - \beta$$

### 3.3 Joint Position Calculation

Using unit vector $\hat{u} = (\vec{C} - \vec{A}) / D$ and orthogonalized pole vector $\hat{p}$ (pointing forward $+Z$):
$$\vec{B}_{\text{knee}} = \vec{A} + \hat{u} \cdot (L_1 \cos \alpha) + \hat{p} \cdot (L_1 \sin \alpha)$$

Both bone segment lengths are preserved with machine precision:
$$|\vec{B} - \vec{A}| = L_1 \quad \text{and} \quad |\vec{C} - \vec{B}| = L_2$$

## 4. Foot Grounding, Heel Strike, and Toe Roll

The foot placement solver evaluates single-leg phase $p \in [0, 1)$:

### 4.1 Stance Phase ($p \le 0.60$)

- **Horizontal Trajectory**: Moves linearly rearward relative to hip:
  $$z = z_{\text{reach}} - (2 z_{\text{reach}}) \cdot \frac{p}{0.60}$$
- **Heel Strike** ($p / 0.60 < 0.18$): Heel contacts floor; foot is dorsiflexed:
  $$\theta_{\text{pitch}} = -0.30 \cdot \left(1 - \frac{p / 0.60}{0.18}\right) \text{ rad}$$
- **Midstance / Flat Foot** ($0.18 \le p / 0.60 < 0.65$): Foot sits completely flat on the floor ($\theta_{\text{pitch}} = 0, y = \text{footH}$).
- **Push-Off / Toe Roll** ($p / 0.60 \ge 0.65$): Heel rises while toe stays on ground; foot rolls up to $+0.45\text{ rad}$ ($+26^\circ$).

### 4.2 Swing Phase ($p > 0.60$)

- **Forward Trajectory**: Smoothstep curve accelerates forward from $-z_{\text{reach}}$ to $+z_{\text{reach}}$.
- **Vertical Foot Clearance**: Parabolic elevation arc clearing the floor:
  $$y = \text{footH} + \text{stepHeight} \cdot \sin(\pi \cdot s) \quad \text{where } s = \frac{p - 0.60}{0.40}$$

---

## 5. Pelvis & Upper Body Dynamics

### 5.1 Pelvis Oscillation

- **Vertical Bounce** (Double Frequency):
  $$y_{\text{bounce}} = -A_{\text{bounce}} \cdot \cos(4\pi \phi)$$
- **Lateral Sway**:
  $$x_{\text{sway}} = A_{\text{sway}} \cdot \sin(2\pi \phi)$$
- **Pelvic Roll** (Lateral Tilt):
  $$R_z = A_{\text{roll}} \cdot \sin(2\pi \phi)$$
- **Pelvic Yaw** (Transverse Rotation):
  $$R_y = A_{\text{yaw}} \cdot \cos(2\pi \phi)$$

### 5.2 Torso & Arm Counter-Dynamics

- **Spine & Chest Counter-Rotation**: Rotates around Y in the opposite direction of the pelvis:
  $$R_{y, \text{torso}} = -R_{y, \text{pelvis}} \cdot \text{torsoCounter} \cdot 0.5$$
- **Arm Swing**: Left arm swings in phase with the right leg ($\phi_{\text{armL}} = (\phi + 0.5) \pmod 1.0$).
  $$\theta_{\text{shoulder}} = A_{\text{swing}} \cdot \sin(2\pi \phi_{\text{arm}})$$
- **Elbow Flexion**: Arm bends on forward swing and extends on backswing:
  $$\theta_{\text{elbow}} = 0.15 + A_{\text{elbow}} \cdot \max(0, \sin(2\pi \phi_{\text{arm}})) + 0.06 \cdot \max(0, -\sin(2\pi \phi_{\text{arm}}))$$
- **Wrist Secondary Lag**:
  $$\theta_{\text{wrist}} = -A_{\text{wrist}} \cdot \cos(2\pi \phi_{\text{arm}})$$

## 6. Root Motion & Transform Authority

During every step, the locomotion evaluator outputs:

```text
rootMotionIntent {
  deltaX: 0,
  deltaY: 0,
  deltaZ: speed * deltaSeconds,
  speed: strideLength * (cadence / 120),
  totalDistance: cumulativeMeters
}
```

The engine's `commitRootMotionIntent(intent, transform, mode)` consumes this intent:
- **`'in_place'`** (Treadmill Studio Mode): Leaves `transform.position` at $(0, 0, 0)$ on the 1-meter floor grid for visual foot contact inspection while updating `totalDistance`.
- **`'forward'`**: Translates `transform.position.z += intent.deltaZ`.

## 7. The 8 Visual Failure Criteria

Before declaring motion truth, procedural motion is verified against these cardinal failure modes:

1. **Obvious Foot Sliding**: Stance foot moving relative to ground while in contact phase.
2. **Foot Penetration or Floating**: Feet sinking beneath ground ($Y < 0$) or hovering in stance ($Y > 0.025$).
3. **Knee / Elbow Collapse or Popping**: Limbs suddenly flipping or hyper-extending at inflection points.
4. **Severe Volume Loss**: Mesh thinning to a paper-like waist or candy-wrapper twisting during joint rotation.
5. **Rigid Pendulum Limbs**: Limbs swinging as stiff wooden rods without elbow flex or wrist lag.
6. **Mechanical Pelvis**: Pelvis translating like an elevator on rails without dynamic bounce, roll, and yaw.
7. **Loop Discontinuity**: Stutter or jerk at cycle boundary repetitions.
8. **Mannequin-Like Rigidity**: Character moving as disjoint rigid shapes without organic weight transfer.

## 8. Non-Goals & Boundaries for Motion Forge

1. **No External MoCap Files**: Does not import BVH, FBX animations, or captured mocap tracks.
2. **No Ragdoll Physics**: Physical death simulations belong to later physics proofs.
3. **No Combat Move Sets**: Punches, kicks, and hit reactions belong to Proof B2 (Combat Room).
4. **No Transform Commits**: Motion Forge never writes directly to authoritative world coordinates.

## 9. Proof C terrain samples

`evaluator.update(dt, { groundAt })` optionally accepts a callback receiving each
foot target's character-local X/Z. It returns `{height, normal?}`, where height is
relative to the mesh root and normal is a unit upward vector in character-local
coordinates. Nonfinite heights and invalid normals throw an error with code
`MOTION_INVALID_GROUND_SAMPLE`. Callers without this option execute the accepted
flat-ground path unchanged.

The terrain path adds sampled elevation to ankle targets, aligns foot orientation
to the normal and adjusts ankle height by `footH * (1 / normal.y - 1)` for the
oriented sole. It disables ankle-pivot toe roll, which otherwise drives toes into
slopes. The pelvis receives 0.06 m additional reach clearance and lowers by the
minimum of zero and the two sampled relative ground heights. This is a bounded
extension to the existing two-bone solve, not a new motion architecture.

Proof C's coordinator transforms targets into world coordinates, samples
WorldFieldQuery, and converts the result back. It advances gait by resolved travel
distance and owns entity transform commits. Rendering projects/interpolates those
commits without advancing gait. Realized foot bones and skinned sole vertices are
tested against world height in `tests/world.test.js`, including non-flat samples,
turns and the controlled traversal. The same file repeats B1's flat realized-foot
probe for average, athletic and heavy. Terrain adaptation does not implement
world-space foot locking, turn blending or arbitrary steps/overhangs.

With terrain sampling, `standing: true` places both feet under their hips in
contact while preserving gait phase. C uses this when actual travel stops, so an
idle or blocked character does not retain a suspended swing foot. The transition
is immediate; there is no new idle-animation or blend framework.
