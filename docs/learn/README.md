# Learning My Game Engine 1.0

## Purpose

The `docs/learn/` directory contains educational guides, architectural walkthroughs, and code-level lessons for **My Game Engine 1.0**.

Canonical repository:

`sumosizedginger/My-Game-Engine-1.0`

Every lesson in this directory is extracted **exclusively from accepted, verified, and frozen implementations**.

## 1. The Law of Learning Documents

Under `AGENTS.md` and `DOCUMENTATION_MAP.md`, learning materials operate under strict constitutional constraints:

```text
BUILD
→ TEST
→ RUN
→ CAPTURE
→ AUDIT
→ ACCEPT
→ TEACH
```

1. **No Speculative Architecture**: We never teach planned, promised, or hypothetical APIs. If a feature does not exist as tested code in the canonical repository, it does not appear in a learning guide.
2. **Authority Order**: Canonical specifications (`CONSTITUTION.md`, `PRD.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `GAMEPLAY_FOUNDATION.md`) outrank learning guides. If a tutorial and a canonical specification conflict, the specification wins and the tutorial must be updated.
3. **Inspectable & Executable Companions**: Code examples in these lessons are extracted directly from working source files and test suites. They are designed to be inspected, verified, and run using the engine's real toolchain.
4. **Subsystem Visibility vs. Package Exports**: Learning guides for 3D proofs (B1, B2, C, D) reference accepted repository-level engine systems (e.g. `src/geometry/`, `src/material/`, `src/character/`, `src/motion/`, `src/world/`). These are internal repository implementations, not package subpath exports. Ordinary project code does not require them merely to create 3D presentation; direct Three.js presentation in project code remains fully legitimate where procedural forge compilation is not required.

## 3. How to Follow Along

To run and inspect the implementation taught in these guides:

```bash
# Clean dependency installation
npm ci

# Run the complete automated test suite (186 unit tests across 11 suites)
npm test

# Run the headless browser evaluation harness (six-target validation + captures)
npm run eval

# Build the static production bundle
npm run build

# Start the local development server for interactive browser play
npm run dev
```
