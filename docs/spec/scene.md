This is the first document in the earned tier created under `CONSTITUTION.md` §29.1. It exists because scene composition is implemented, not because it is planned.

## 1. What a scene is

**A scene is engine data. It is not a renderer scene graph.**

A `SceneDefinition` describes what a composed space contains, how its parts relate, and where they sit. It holds no geometry, no renderer objects and no runtime handles. Rendering **consumes** a scene; it never owns one.

```text
SceneDefinition  ->  compileScene()  ->  SceneArtifact  ->  instantiateScene()  ->  SceneInstance
    source              compile            artifact              runtime              transient
```

This is the Definition / Artifact / Runtime separation `CONSTITUTION.md` §3 requires, applied to composition.

The test that keeps this honest: a scene compiled without ever touching the renderer is a complete scene. It simply is not on screen. `tests/purity.test.js` asserts that no module under `src/scene/` imports Three.js.

---

## 2. Identity

Two identities meet here and must never be confused.

| | Owned by | Stable across | Serialized |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `pid` — persistent authored id | the **source** | compile, serialize, unload, reload | **yes** |
| `EntityHandle(index, generation)` — runtime id | an **instance** | nothing; reallocated every instantiation | **never** |

`CONSTITUTION.md` §14 forbids serializing runtime handles. `tests/scene.test.js` checks this at the byte level: the canonical scene text must contain no `index`, no `generation`, and no mention of a handle.

Unloading and reinstantiating an artifact yields **the same pids and different handles**. That is the property future streaming, save and networking work depends on, and it is asserted directly rather than assumed.

### 2.1 Known limit — handles are pool-scoped

An `EntityHandle` is meaningful only with the entity manager that issued it. Two managers each starting from an empty pool both allocate `{index: 0, generation: 1}`: the values collide while referring to different entities, and a handle value carries no pool identity, so **no lookup can tell them apart.**

A `SceneInstance` therefore stamps a unique `instanceId` into the entity data it creates and checks it in `pidFor()` and `owns()`. That makes ownership decidable when instances **share** an entity manager — the realistic multi-scene shape — and it cannot help across separate pools.

Making handle values globally unique would mean changing runtime identity architecture, which was outside this tranche. **Scenes that must interoperate should share one entity manager**, which `instantiateScene` supports directly.

---

## 3. SceneDefinition v1

```text
SceneDefinition {
  version:      1
  id:           string
  units:        'm'
  upAxis:       '+Y'
  forwardAxis:  '-Z'
  nodes:        SceneNode[]
}

SceneNode {
  pid:        string        persistent authored identity, unique per scene
  name:       string        semantic name; anonymous nodes are refused
  parent:     string|null   parent pid, or null for a root
  transform:  LocalTRS      LOCAL, relative to the parent
  tags:       string[]      lightweight authored metadata, sorted
  asset:      string|null   OPAQUE presentation key; the scene never interprets it
}

LocalTRS {
  translation: [x, y, z]      finite
  rotation:    [x, y, z, w]   finite UNIT quaternion
  scale:       [x, y, z]      finite, non-zero, positive
}
```

**The rotation must be a unit quaternion**, to a tolerance of
`QUATERNION_UNIT_TOLERANCE` (`1e-6`, exported from `src/geometry/mesh.js`).

A non-unit quaternion scales as a side effect of rotating: `[0, 0, 0.5, 0.5]`
has length 0.707, so it shrinks a node to 70.7% even though its authored scale
says `[1, 1, 1]`. That is an implicit scale the author never wrote, and it is
invisible in the source.

Non-unit quaternions are **refused, never normalized**. Two reasons:

1. **Normalizing rewrites authored source.** The definition is what a human or
   an AI reads back to understand the scene. Silently changing it makes the
   source stop describing the artifact.
2. **The engine already decided this.** `transformMesh` enforces exactly the
   same contract for geometry, with exactly the same tolerance. Scene
   composition consumes that constant rather than inventing a second one, so
   the two cannot drift into disagreeing about what a valid transform is.

The TRS representation is **the one the engine already owns** for geometry (`transformMesh` in `src/geometry/mesh-ops.js`). Reusing it rather than inventing a second convention is deliberate: a node's world placement must agree with what the same TRS would have done to a mesh.

### 3.1 Why `asset` is an opaque string

A node references geometry by key. The scene layer never resolves it. This is what keeps a definition renderer-independent and serializable, and it is why `examples/scenes/subterra-cell/` returns its definition and its asset library as two separate things.

---

## 4. Validation

`validateSceneDefinition(definition) -> { valid, diagnostics }`, matching the `validateMesh` contract. Every defect is reported, not just the first.

| Code | Refused |
| --- | --- |
| `SCENE_VERSION`, `SCENE_ID`, `SCENE_CONVENTION` | malformed header |
| `SCENE_PID_INVALID` | missing or malformed persistent id |
| `SCENE_DUPLICATE_PID` | two nodes sharing an identity |
| `SCENE_NAME_REQUIRED` | anonymous node |
| `SCENE_MISSING_PARENT` | parent not present in this scene |
| `SCENE_SELF_PARENT` | node parented to itself |
| `SCENE_CYCLE` | hierarchy ring; a scene is a forest, not a graph |
| `SCENE_TRANSFORM_INVALID` | non-finite translation, rotation or scale |
| `SCENE_ROTATION_DEGENERATE` | zero-length quaternion: defines no orientation at all |
| `SCENE_ROTATION_NOT_UNIT` | finite, non-degenerate, but not unit length: would apply an implicit scale |
| `SCENE_SCALE_INVALID` | zero or negative scale |
| `SCENE_TOO_LARGE` | over `SCENE_MAX_NODES` (4096) |
| `SCENE_ASSET_INVALID`, `SCENE_TAGS_INVALID` | malformed metadata |

**No silent correction.** A structurally ambiguous hierarchy is refused with a diagnostic naming what is wrong. Guessing what an author meant is how editor-only truth gets established.

One defect produces one diagnostic: a self-parent is not also reported as a missing parent and a cycle, and a three-node ring is one `SCENE_CYCLE`, not three. The same applies to a malformed quaternion — a zero quaternion is degenerate, not *also* non-unit, even though both are technically true.

---

## 5. Compilation

`compileScene(definition) -> SceneArtifact` (frozen).

The compiler validates, establishes canonical order, derives world transforms and freezes. **Validation is the authoritative source gate**: `matrixFromTRS` assumes a unit quaternion and neither normalizes nor re-validates, because a second gate competing with the first is how contracts drift. It does **not** render, own GPU resources, run gameplay or hold state between calls. It is not Kiln: Kiln is the engine-wide compile/bake system (`ARCHITECTURE.md` §6) and remains unbuilt.

### 5.1 Canonical order

Every parent precedes its children; siblings keep authored order. The order is a pure function of the definition, so the same definition always compiles to the same artifact, and sibling order is preserved because it is authoring intent.

### 5.2 World composition is matrix composition

**Local authoring is TRS. Compiled world placement is an affine matrix.**

```text
localMatrix      = T * R * S
worldMatrix      = parentWorldMatrix * localMatrix
root worldMatrix = localMatrix
```

`T * R * S` means scale first, then rotate, then translate — the same order `transformMesh` applies to geometry, so a node's placement agrees with what the same TRS would have done to a mesh.

#### Why not TRS

A composed world placement is **not** always representable as translation plus quaternion plus component-wise scale. Nesting a non-uniform scale above a rotation produces **shear**, and a shear-capable affine transform has no TRS decomposition.

The original revision composed world placement as three independent parts and was wrong for exactly that case:

```text
root        scale [2, 1, 1]
child       rotation 90 degrees about Z
grandchild  translation [1, 0, 0]

correct                   [0, 1, 0]
independent-TRS model     [0, 2, 0]
```

It applied the parent's scale to the child's offset *before* the parent's rotation, which is not what the authored chain means. Two different failures follow from one cause: a wrong position even where no shear exists, and shear that cannot be expressed at all.

#### Convention — stated, not inferred

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Vectors | **Column vectors.** Transforms apply right to left: `M * p`. |
| Storage | **Column-major**, flat array of 16 numbers. Row `r`, column `c` is index `c * 4 + r`. |
| Translation | elements 12, 13, 14 |
| Why column-major | matches WebGL and Three.js, so the renderer consumes a matrix with no transpose. A silent transpose is exactly the convention mismatch this table exists to prevent. |

`tests/scene.test.js` asserts the convention directly rather than leaving it to be inferred from behaviour.

Primitives live in `src/scene/affine.js`: `identityMatrix`, `matrixFromTRS`, `multiplyMatrices`, `transformPoint`, `translationOf`, `hasShear`. It is deliberately not a math library — one consumer does not earn a shared one.

### 5.3 Artifact identity

- `sourceHash` — canonical scene text through the engine's existing `hashBytes`.
- `artifactHash` — covers the **compiled world matrices**, so a compiler change that alters placement is visible even when the source is untouched. Matrices are hashed rather than derived translation alone, because a change that rotated or sheared every node in place would otherwise be invisible.

`SCENE_ARTIFACT_VERSION` is **2**. Version 1 exposed `world.rotation` and `world.scale`, which are not generally derivable from a composed hierarchy.

Canonical serialization ignores incidental ordering: two authorings of one scene that differ only in object key order or tag order produce identical bytes.

---

## 6. Runtime instantiation

`instantiateScene(artifact, { entityManager, transformManager }) -> SceneInstance`

Managers are optional and must be supplied **together or not at all** — a borrowed entity manager with a fresh transform manager would silently split transform authority across two stores. When omitted, the instance creates and owns them.

### 6.1 Transform authority

| Node | Ownership | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| root | `STATIC` | immovable scenery |
| parented | `ATTACHED` | `GAMEPLAY_FOUNDATION.md` §3.1 already defines `ATTACHED` as "derives world transform hierarchically from a parent entity" |

Composition introduces **no new ownership mode and no second per-tick writer**. It publishes the derived world *position* into the existing transform manager once, at instantiation. Neither `STATIC` nor `ATTACHED` is moved by `commitAll`, which `tests/scene.test.js` verifies by ticking the clock and asserting positions are unchanged.

### 6.2 World placement shape

```text
world {
  matrix:      [16 numbers]   AUTHORITATIVE, column-major affine
  translation: [x, y, z]      derived: where the matrix puts the local origin
  sheared:     boolean        true when the basis columns are not perpendicular
}
```

There is deliberately **no `world.rotation` and no `world.scale`**. For a sheared hierarchy those values do not exist, and publishing them would be a confident lie that every consumer would then trust.

`sheared` is recorded rather than hidden, so a consumer that genuinely needs a TRS decomposition can detect when one is unavailable instead of computing a wrong one.

### 6.3 Rotation and scale are not in the runtime transform

The runtime `Transform` record owns position and velocity only. Scene composition does **not** extend it. The published position is read out of the authoritative world matrix, so the two can never disagree. Consumers needing full placement read `worldMatrixOf(pid)`, which is derived artifact data rather than a competing mutable transform store.

### 6.4 Queries

```text
handleFor(pid)          pidFor(handle)         owns(handle)
nodeFor(pid)            worldTransformOf(pid)  worldMatrixOf(pid)
localTransformOf(pid)   childrenOf(pid)        parentOf(pid)
roots()                 members()              getDiagnostics()
size / disposed / instanceId
```

Deliberately not a query language and not ECS selectors. These are the questions the forcing consumer actually asked.

### 6.5 Lifecycle

`dispose()` despawns every entity this instance created, which bumps each slot generation so every handle it issued becomes permanently stale. Borrowed managers keep serving other consumers; owned managers are cleared. Repeated disposal is safe. A disposed instance **throws** on runtime queries rather than answering stale ones.

---

## 7. Public API

| Surface | Exports | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `engine/runtime` | `instantiateScene`, `liveSceneInstanceCount` | an exported game instantiates and queries compiled scenes |
| `engine/full` | definition, validation, codec, compiler | authoring and compilation are not shipped with a game |

This split is `CONSTITUTION.md` §5: a small exported game must not carry the whole authoring toolchain. `tests/purity.test.js` asserts that `compileScene`, `createSceneDefinition`, `encodeScene` and friends are absent from `engine/runtime`.

`tests/subterra-cell.test.js` asserts the forcing consumer imports **only** the public package — no deep import into `src/`, no renderer types.

---

## 8. Presentation adapter

`src/render/scene-presentation.js` is the one-way boundary between an instantiated scene and Three.js. It reads a scene and produces renderer objects; nothing upstream knows it exists.

**Flat object tree.** Nodes are added as siblings, each carrying its already-composed world matrix, rather than mirrored into a nested `Object3D` hierarchy. The compiler has already composed the hierarchy; rebuilding it in the renderer would create a second place where composition happens and therefore a second chance for the two to disagree.

**The matrix is installed, never decomposed.** `object.matrix` is set from the compiled matrix and `matrixAutoUpdate` is turned off, because Three.js would otherwise recompose `matrix` from its own position/quaternion/scale and overwrite it. Correct compiler math followed by a decomposing renderer would leave the visible bug alive, so `tests/scene-browser.test.js` compares renderer matrices against compiled matrices element by element, and asserts that a sheared matrix is still sheared after it reaches the renderer.

**Resource sharing.** Geometry is shared per asset key and materials per id, so a cell placing the same crate twice uploads one crate. This is resource sharing, **not draw-call batching** — render compilation is a separate concern and is not started here.

Renderer objects carry `userData.scenePid`, so a picked mesh resolves back to its authored node without a side table.

---

## 9. Forcing consumer — SUBTERRA cell

`examples/scenes/subterra-cell/` is a bounded constructed underground service cell, built entirely through public authoring verbs. Its job is to put pressure on the scene model, not to be beautiful.

```text
37 authored nodes · depth 3 · 1 root · 15 assets · 8 materials · 25 renderer objects
```

It exercises: assemblies whose children are placed in the parent's frame (a raised doorway carries its posts and header); a door leaf three levels deep and yawed within its assembly; a console yawed a quarter turn whose display is tilted within the console's own frame; one wall asset placed twice with one rotated a half turn; repeated crates and brackets sharing uploaded geometry.

Two placement defects were found only by looking at real renders — a console display floating above its desk and a crate hovering above the one below it. Neither was detectable from source inspection or from a green test suite.

SUBTERRA authors **no scale at all**, so it can never shear. That makes it unable to detect a renderer that decomposes world placement, which is why `examples/scenes/affine-probe/` exists as a dedicated transform fixture. The probe contains the validator's reproduction plus two branches authoring the *same* scale and rotation in opposite nesting order: one shears, one does not. It is a fixture, not content, and adds no scene capability.

---

## 10. Evidence

| Kind | Where |
| --- | --- |
| Unit and contract | `tests/scene.test.js` — 43 tests |
| Forcing consumer | `tests/subterra-cell.test.js` — 11 tests |
| Real browser | `tests/scene-browser.test.js` — 13 subtests |
| Evaluator target | `?scene=subterra&controlled=1`, checks `sceneBoot`, `sceneComposition`, `sceneHierarchy`, `sceneWorldTransforms`, `scenePresentation`, `sceneUnload`, `sceneReloadIdentity`, `sceneHandleRenewal`, `sceneNoLeak`, `scenePageProofSuccess` |
| Visual | `artifacts/captures/scene_subterra_cell_fixture.png` |

Browser evidence covers what unit tests cannot: that the scene reaches the screen, that renderer objects sit at composed world transforms, that unload releases what load acquired, that five lifecycle cycles change no resource count, that no permanent animation frame is scheduled, and that dispose and double-dispose are safe.

---

## 11. Boundaries — what this subsystem does NOT do

| Not implemented | Why |
| --- | --- |
| **Prefabs** | hierarchy alone was enough for this tranche. `SceneDefinition` does not foreclose a later `PrefabDefinition` instantiating into a scene. |
| **Reparenting** | nothing required it. A mature editor having it is not evidence. |
| **Scene transitions** | orchestration belongs to later runtime and game work. |
| **Streaming and chunking** | this tranche proves only that an instance can be created and destroyed cleanly, which is streaming's first prerequisite. |
| **Save games** | scene serialization is **source** serialization, not player save data. Future save state will *reference* persistent scene identity; it is not this. |
| **Networking** | nothing here requires a global mutable scene singleton, and that is the whole obligation for now. |
| **Render batching** | `ARCHITECTURE.md` §48 and `ROADMAP.md` §46.1. Measurement precedes optimization. |
| **Rotation/scale in the runtime transform** | the runtime `Transform` owns position and velocity. Extending it is transform-architecture work. |

No global scene singleton exists. Two independent `SceneInstance`s can coexist, and `tests/scene.test.js` proves disposing one does not disturb the other.

---

## 12. Known limitations

1. **Handles are pool-scoped** (§2.1). Cross-pool handle values can collide and are indistinguishable.
2. **World matrices are derived once, at compile time.** Moving a node after compilation is not supported; there is no live hierarchy update. A scene is currently static composition.

   **No inverse and no decomposition.** `src/scene/affine.js` has no matrix inverse and no TRS extraction, because nothing has needed them. A consumer wanting a node's placement relative to another node, or a TRS for an unsheared node, would have to earn those.
3. **`asset` keys are unvalidated by the scene layer.** A key with no library entry is reported by the presentation adapter as `unresolvedKeys`, not refused at compile time, because the scene layer deliberately does not know what assets exist.
4. **The presentation adapter emits one renderer object per asset-bearing node**, which is the same authoring-granularity-equals-render-granularity coupling `ARCHITECTURE.md` §48 records for MeshIR parts. It is not addressed here.
5. **No spatial index.** `nodeFor(pid)` is a linear scan over the artifact's nodes. Fine at 37 nodes and at the 4096-node ceiling it is not; a real world will need indexing.

---

## 12.1 Repair record

### R1 — affine hierarchy and artifact immutability

Independent validation failed the first revision (`95ad733`) with two blocking defects. Both are repaired; neither was an input-validation problem, and both definitions involved validated cleanly.

**Hierarchical transforms were mathematically wrong.** World placement was composed as independent scale, rotation and translation, which loses the ordering between a parent's scale and a parent's rotation and cannot represent shear. Repaired by making a 4x4 affine matrix the authoritative compiled placement (§5.2). Reproduction: grandchild world position went from `[0, 2, 0]` to the correct `[0, 1, 0]`.

**Compiled artifacts aliased their source.** `tags` and the local transform were stored by reference, so a caller mutating a plain-object definition after compilation changed the artifact while `artifactHash` stayed put. Repaired by taking an owned, deep-frozen snapshot before anything is derived (§5), with regressions that deliberately use mutable plain objects because `createSceneDefinition` freezes its output and hid the defect.

### R2 — unit-quaternion source contract

Re-audit of `e205c46` found one further blocking defect: scene validation accepted any finite, non-zero quaternion, while `src/scene/affine.js` uses the quaternion directly in a rotation-matrix formula that assumes unit length.

```text
rotation [0, 0, 0.5, 0.5], scale [1, 1, 1]

before   VALID; X basis length 0.7071 — an implicit 29% shrink
after    REJECTED with SCENE_ROTATION_NOT_UNIT; compileScene fails closed
```

Repaired by sharing the contract geometry already had. `QUATERNION_UNIT_TOLERANCE` moved from a module-private constant in `src/geometry/mesh-ops.js` into the MeshIR core at `src/geometry/mesh.js`, and is now consumed by both `transformMesh` and `validateSceneDefinition`. The value, the comparison and `transformMesh`'s behaviour are unchanged; only the constant's home moved, so the two systems cannot drift onto separately invented tolerances.

`SCENE_ROTATION_NOT_UNIT` is a new code rather than an overload of `SCENE_ROTATION_DEGENERATE`: a length-0.5 quaternion defines a perfectly good orientation and fails for a different reason than one that defines none.

SUBTERRA and the affine probe both validate unchanged under the stronger contract — worst deviation across every authored quaternion is 2.22e-16, nine orders of magnitude inside tolerance. No content moved and no source hash changed.

### Consequences worth knowing:

- `SCENE_ARTIFACT_VERSION` went 1 → 2. `world.rotation` and `world.scale` were removed rather than kept as a mathematically false convenience; the branch was unaccepted, so there was nothing to stay compatible with.
- SUBTERRA's rendered output is **unchanged**. It authors no scale, so the old and new composition agree there — which is why the cell could not have caught this and the affine probe exists.
- `examples/scenes/affine-probe/` and `src/scene/affine.js` are new.

## 13. Routing

Load this document for scene composition, hierarchy, scene serialization or scene lifecycle work. It does not govern rendering, geometry authoring or runtime simulation. See `DOCUMENTATION_MAP.md` for the full routing rules and `CONSTITUTION.md` §29 for why this tier exists.
